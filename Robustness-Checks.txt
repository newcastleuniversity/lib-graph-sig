ROBUSTNESS CHECKS

 - jUnit test cases for all relevant methods, reaching high coverage.
 - jUnit test cases testing graceful handling of error conditions.
 - 0 SpotBugs reported.
 - Errors caught as early as possible, e.g., constructors asserting non-null inputs.
 - Thread-safe: methods and fields robust against multiple calls.
   (e.g., iterators only local to their use).
 - Input validation for network/service inputs (e.g., challenges and hat-values).
 - Enforcing length constraints that yield the guarantees of the Camenisch-Lysyanskaya proofs.
 - Standard interfaces for provers/verifiers etc. enforcing common paradigms.
 - Interfaces exposing only methods suitable for external use.
